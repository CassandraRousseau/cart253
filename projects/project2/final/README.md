# **Project 02: Anything**

## **Artist's statement**

_Ephemeral_ is a game where there is a strong story emphasis. I wanted the users to immerse themselves into an interactive
universe in which they have the same feeling as reading a book. I wanted the users to live a similar reading experience within this game; a perspective that they are reading a storybook instead of playing an usual game.

I think I succeeded to create this immersive experience by separating levels into chapters. I think it is a obvious aspect for creating a storytelling. I also created a prologue and epilogue to explain the game's context to users. I put a flipping page sound effect to give the users the impression they are turning the page of a book through their screen. I added a background music, which I edited by adding a spooky/creepy aspect with the rate option in p5.sound library. This background music helps the users to understand the environment of the game, which immerse them more into the universe. I made a lot of cutscenes (i.e., illustrations) to create the effect that the users are reading a storybook. I putted quotation marks to each characters' dialogs to not forget that it is an interactive book users are reading.

To create the interactive aspect of the game, users have to collect the magic petals through the eyes of the main character. We are accompanying the main character in her journey. Players are affecting the story by whether or not collecting the petals through the levels. The user collect them through various environments. I tried to create levels the most various as possible to not create repetitive and boring interactivity. From searching a petal through screaming into a cave, which makes the petal appears, to searching into a castle where the magic petal is hidden.

I tried to build up a progressive storyline (i.e., like an usual story used to be) to grow the interest of the player more and more through the game. I tried to reveal bit by bit elements of the universe to not lose the interest of users.
