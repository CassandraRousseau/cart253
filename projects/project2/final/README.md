# **Project 02: Anything**

## **Artist's statement**

_Ephemeral_ is a game where there is a strong story emphasis. I wanted the users to immerse themselves into an interactive
universe with the same feeling as reading a book. I wanted the users to live a similar reading experience within this game; a perspective that they are reading a book instead of playing a usual game.

I think I succeeded to create this immersive experience by at first creating chapters for each levels. I even created
a prologue and epilogue to put the context of the game for the users. I put a flipping page sound effect for the users
to have the impression they are turning the page of a book through their screens. I added a background music, which I edited by adding a spooky/creepy aspect through the rate option in p5.sound library. I think this background music helps the user to catch the environment of the game, which immerse him more in the universe. I made a lot of cutscenes (aka illustrations) to create the effect that the user is reading an illustrated book, emphasize this aspect of tale that I
wanted to bring in this game. I putted quotation marks to each characters' dialogs to not forget that they are reading a book.

I did not forget the interactive aspect of this game. I wanted to create an interactive story by collecting the magic petals
through the eyes of the main character. We are accompanying the main character in her journey. We are affecting the story in the levels if wheter or not are collecting the petals. The user collect them through various interactive levels. I tried to create the most various as possible the levels to not make repetitive and boring interactivity. By searching a petal through the to screaming in a cave to make the petal appear.

I tried to build up a progressive storyline (i.e, like a usual story used to be) to grow the interest of the player more and more within the game progress. I tried to reveal bit by bit elements of the universe to not lose the interst of the user.
