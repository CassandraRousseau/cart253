# **Project 02: Anything**

## **Cassandra Rousseau Artist's statement**

_Ephemeral_ is a game with a strong story emphasis. I wanted the users to immerse themselves into an interactive
universe in which they experience a similar feeling as when they are reading a book; a perspective that they are reading a storybook instead of playing a usual game.

I think I succeeded in creating this immersive experience by separating the levels into chapters. I think it is an obvious aspect for creating a storytelling. I also created a prologue and epilogue to explain the game’s context to users. I put a flipping page sound effect to give the users the impression they are turning a page of the book through their screen. I added a background music to help the users to understand the environment of the game, which immerse them more into the universe. I edited the music by adding a spooky/creepy aspect with the rate option in p5.sound library. I created a lot of cutscenes (i.e., illustrations) to amplify the effect that the users are reading a storybook. I putted quotation marks to each character’s dialogues not to forget that users are reading a book.

To create the interactive aspect of the game, users have to collect the magic petals through the eyes of the main character. We are accompanying the main character in her journey. Players are affecting the story by whether or not collecting the petals through the levels. The user collects them through various environments. I tried to create levels the most various as possible not to create repetitive and boring interactivity. From searching a petal by screaming into a cave, which makes the petal appear, to searching into a castle where the magic petal is hidden.

I tried to build a progressive plot (i.e., like usual stories used to be) to grow the interest of the player more and more through the game. I tried to reveal bit-by-bit elements of the universe to not lose the interest of users.
